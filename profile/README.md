## 🧩 Overview  

**Keyboard Maestro for macOS** is a professional-grade automation tool designed to eliminate repetitive tasks and supercharge your daily workflow. Developed by **Stairways Software**, it allows you to create advanced macros that automate nearly every aspect of your Mac — from launching apps and typing text to executing complex logic-based workflows.  

What makes Keyboard Maestro unique is its **visual macro editor**, enabling you to design automations without coding — while still offering deep scripting power through **AppleScript**, **Shell**, and **JavaScript for Automation**. It’s flexible, powerful, and fully customizable, giving both beginners and power users the tools to build their own personalized productivity system.  

You can trigger macros using **hotkeys**, **typed phrases**, **USB or MIDI inputs**, or even events like connecting to Wi-Fi or opening an app. Its **clipboard manager**, **window control**, and **text expansion** features make it indispensable for creators, developers, editors, and professionals who live in macOS.  

Optimized for the latest **Apple Silicon chips**, Keyboard Maestro runs faster than ever and integrates perfectly with external controllers such as the **Stream Deck**, creating a seamless, tactile automation experience.
